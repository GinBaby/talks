-- Intuitively, it can't be made a monad because in a monad, the effect 
-- (i.e. the validation failures) of a computation can depend on previously 
-- bound results. But in the case of a failure, there is no result. So Either 
-- has no choice than to short-circuit to failure in that case, since there is 
-- nothing to feed to the subsequent functions on right-hand sides of (>>=)s.

-- This is in stark contrast to applicative functors, where the effect (in this 
--     case, the validation failures) cannot depend on other results, which is 
-- why we can get all validation failures without having to feed results (where 
--     would they come from?) from one computation to the other.
